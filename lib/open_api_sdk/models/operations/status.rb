    # Status - Useful for marking a commission as refunded, duplicate, canceled, or fraudulent. Takes precedence over `amount` and `modifyAmount`. When a commission is marked as refunded, duplicate, canceled, or fraudulent, it will be omitted from the payout, and the payout amount will be recalculated accordingly. Paid commissions cannot be updated.
